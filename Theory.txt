# Idea 1: Reverse lookup
If we scan for ".?AVtype_info@@" and extract the type info vftable address
we can find all TypeDescriptors with a big ol scan.

# Idea 2: Fastest Method Possible
Step 1:
For each target module we:
	- Parse its sections
	- Find .text and .rdata
	- record their location and size

Step 2:
	- Scan .rdata for vftables and attempt to validate them
		- Validation is where vftable_start points to code, and the COL (previous pointer) points to valid .rdata COL
		- Function count ends when we hit the next COL (or maybe when we hit nulls? depends)
		- Parse RTTI for found vftable(s)

this is much faster, probably more reliable, but a bit more hands on.
